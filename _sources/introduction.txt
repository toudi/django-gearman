*django-gearman* is a convenience wrapper for the [Gearman]_
[python-gearman]_.


With django-gearman, you can code jobs as well as clients in a Django project
with minimal overhead in your application. Server connections etc. all take
place in django-gearman and don't unnecessarily clog your application code.
